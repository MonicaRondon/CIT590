# This is a program written by Monica Rondon that is called "Pig".
# "Pig" simulates the game Pig.
# In the game Pig, two players each take turns rolling a six-sided die.
# When it is a player's turn they may roll the die as many times as they wish or until they roll a 1.
# Each number the player rolls in a turn, except a 1, is added to their score.
# However, if the player rolls a 1, their score for this turn is zero, and their turn ends.
# The score from each turn is cumulative.
# The first player to reach or exceed a score of 100 wins.
