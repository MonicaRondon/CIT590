""" This is a program written by Monica Rondon that is called "Pig".
"Pig" simulates the game Pig.
In the game Pig, two players each take turns rolling a six-sided die.
When it is a player's turn they may roll the die as many times as they wish or
until they roll a 1.
Each number the player rolls in a turn, except a 1, is added to their score.
If the player rolls a 1, their score for this turn is zero, and their turn ends.
The score from each turn is cumulative.
The first player to reach or exceed a score of 100 wins. """
